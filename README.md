## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Docker**: Docker Engine installed on your system
- **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose V2 installed
- **Git**: Version control system to clone the repository
- **SSL Certificates**: Valid SSL certificates for HTTPS (required for production)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sali72/my-net-worth
cd my-net-worth
```

2. **Deploy with Docker Compose**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:
- Build the application container
- Start the MongoDB service
- Configure the network between containers
- Start the application with Nginx reverse proxy

## Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:

```env
# DB config
DB_MODE=container
MONGO_DATABASE=my_net_worth_db
MONGO_ROOT_USERNAME=your_db_username
MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_db_password
MONGO_HOST=mongodb

# App config
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
ALGORITHM=HS256
MINIMUM_PASSWORD_STRENGTH=3
```

2. **SSL Configuration**

Place your SSL certificates in:
- `/etc/nginx/ssl/certs/fullchain.pem`
- `/etc/nginx/ssl/private/privkey.pem`

## Security Features
The application implements several security measures using Nginx:

- **SSL/TLS**: Ensures encrypted data transmission
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects against brute force attacks and DoS attempts
- **CORS Protection**: Controls which domains can access the API
- **Request Limitations**: Prevents oversized payload attacks
- **Proxy Protection**: Maintains request integrity behind reverse proxy

## API Documentation
